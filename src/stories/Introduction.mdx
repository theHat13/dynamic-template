# HAT Dynamic Template (HDT) Component Library

Welcome to the HAT Dynamic Template component library. This Storybook showcases all the components used in the HDT project organized according to the Atomic Design methodology.

## Component Structure

Components are organized following the Atomic Design methodology:

- **Atoms**: The smallest building blocks (buttons, form inputs, links)
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together (forms, navigation menus)
- **Organisms**: Complex components composed of molecules and atoms (headers, footers, sections)

## Usage

Browse the components in the sidebar to see examples and documentation. Each component includes:

- Live examples
- Documentation on available props and options
- Default usage and variations

## Development

When adding new components:
1. Create the component in the appropriate directory under `src/_includes`
2. Add a story file in the `src/stories/components` directory
3. Follow the existing pattern for story creation

## Styling

Components use TailwindCSS for styling. The design system tokens are defined in `src/input.css`.
